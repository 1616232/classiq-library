    "# Learning Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a step-by-step example of how to use Classiq platform from the application level. The goal is to show you how easy it can be to use quantum algorithms to solve some problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are going to solve is a very basic optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "*minimize the expression* $3x_1+2x_2$ *for the non-negative integers* $x_1,x_2$, *given the constraint that* $3x_1+x_2\\ge2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this problem is very trivial and the solution is $x_1=1,x_2=0$. The goal is to understand how we can incorporate the problem to the platform, so then you can define more complicated problems by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of optimization problem is relevant for many real-life scenarios, e.g. , if Amazon wants to find the best value it can offer to a costumer for two items in a black-friday sale, but it has some minimum value it has to earn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are we going to solve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now define our optimization problem with a classical optimization package in python called [Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). Once the optimization problem is defined, we will use the platform to convert it to a high-level functional model of quantum algorithms. This functional model is at the heart of our platform (as described earlier) as this is the object that is synthesized to an actual quantum circuit using our synthesis engine!\n",
    "\n",
    "After the circuit is synthesized, we can run it on actual hardware or on a simulator to actually get the result from our quantum algorithm (In this tutorial we will run our algorithm on IBM's quantum simulator as it is the default option).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anything we need to know about quantum algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "We almost do not need to know anything regarding quantum algorithms beside one thing. There are two common algorithms used for optimization problems (as well as chemistry): QAOA and VQE. Both are very similar, where QAOA could be seen as a specific type of VQE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem, we are going to use the QAOA algorithm. The algorithm has 1 mandatory parameter that we will need to choose, as will be explained later-on.\n",
