    "# Randomized Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we perform a full, end to end performance of a randomized benchmarking (RB) experiment using the Classiq platform. The notebook is divided into several parts describing the different steps of the workflow with the Classiq program - Model Definition, Synthesis, Execution and Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Model Definition\n",
    "We start by defining the model, the high level description of the function we want to run and the constraints to which it is subjected.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Define the parameters of the problem. In this specific case we have 5 FunctionParams objects which will correspond to 5 different models. This part is hardware unaware.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Define hardware settings for the problem to run on. Here, these are the basis gates necessary for execution on IBM Quantum machines, which we will do later.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Create models from the results of the previous steps. In this step, we may add additional constraints to models (width, depth, etc.) Specifically for RB, the width is set by `num_of_qubits` and the depth by `num_of_cliffords`. Therefore the synthesis engine won't make use of these constraints, and they are omitted."

The hardwares to run are to be specified by the user, see the [executor user guide](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/executor/index.html) for more details. Here we run on simulators IBM Quantum simulators. These may be replaced by any other hardware, with the proper access credentials. For IBM Quantum hardware access for example, simply replace the ibmq_access_t with an API token from [IBMQ's website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and specify the hardware name in the `backend_name` field of the desired `BackendPreferences` objects."
